### Technical Specifications

#### Threat Coverage
- ✅ Price Manipulation (Oracle attacks)
- ✅ Consensus Attacks (51% validator collusion)
- ✅ Smart Contract Bugs (vulnerabilities)
- ✅ Network Partitions (split consensus)
- ✅ Timing Attacks (MEV/gas manipulation)
- ✅ Unauthorized Access (key compromise)
- ✅ Supply Chain Attacks (malicious dependencies)
- ✅ Post-Quantum Attacks (cryptographic breakthrough)

#### Response Capabilities
- ✅ MONITORING Mode (<2 seconds) - Enhanced surveillance
- ✅ PARTIAL_LOCKDOWN (<5 seconds) - Selective isolation
- ✅ ABSOLUTE_ZERO Protocol (~25 seconds) - Full system protection via Orbital Mirror
- ✅ Graceful Recovery (24-48 hours) - Supervised resumption

#### Security Standards
- NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography (CRYSTALS-Kyber)
- Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus model
- Quantum-resistant key encapsulation
- Post-quantum signature scheme ready (CRYSTALS-Dilithium)

### Integration Points

#### With VLT Sovereign (V2)
- Emergency validator key rotation during threats
- Lunar Vault backup of encryption credentials
- Coordinated pause of token emission during critical threats

#### With GNLL Liquidity Engine
- Threat intelligence feeding market risk assessment
- Automatic rebalancing pause during lockdowns
- Emergency liquidation triggering during Orbital Mirror
- Coordinated recovery verification before resuming operations

### Performance Guarantees

| Metric | Value | Guarantee |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Price threat detection | <500ms | Oracle-independent detection |
| Quantum threat detection | <100ms | ECDSA signature analysis |
| Monitoring activation | <2s | Guaranteed <3s SLA |
| Partial lockdown | <5s | 99.9% availability during transition |
| Orbital Mirror sync | ~25s | All-or-nothing atomic operation |
| Recovery verification | 24-48h | Manual confirmation required |

### Architectural Innovation

MÍA contributes autonomous threat response architecture featuring:

1. **Self-Healing Systems** - Responds to threats without human intervention
